# Approaching a Supervised Machine Learning Problem
This repository is created to give a brief introduction on how to approach a supervised classification problem. Though the problem is classification, the approach can be used for regression problems too.
## Goal
The aim of this repository is not just to achieve the accuracy using any one model. It's more about how you start with the raw data and what tools can be used to get a final solution. I use this repository more like a **revision material** from time to time as I discussed various techniques to get inputs from the data and go over an exhautive list of machine learning algorithms along with my personal notes explaining the algorithm in laymans terms.
## Repository Structure

## Usage
If you want a quick glance, click on the `Notebook.ipynb` which has all the code and outputs with explanations. Or you want to try it on your own, you can download from the github. But I prefer to do it from the command line as I enclosed a `environment.yml` too to give you all the required packages in one shot. The usage steps are:
1. Open your terminal
2. Clone the repoistory using `git clone git@github.com:nvmcr/My_Portfolio.git`.
3. This will create a repository with all my portfolio projects. (sorry if you wanted to clone just the present repo)
4. Enter the present repo using `cd Approaching_SupervisedML_Problem/`.
5. Set up a new virtual environment with all necessary packages and dependencies using `conda env create -f environment.yml`
6. Activate the virtual environment with `conda activate titanic`
6. You can deactivate the virtual environment using `conda deactivate`

## Note on Data Visualization
Instead of using usual `Matplotlib` or popular `Seaborn`, I used a declarative visualization library called `Altair`. It is built upon `Vega` and `Vega-lite`. Though the syntax of `Altair` is bit complex than `Seaborn`, it has many advantages over the later. They have interactive plots, tooltips, huge customizations, awesome selection features (you can control plots through selections in another plot) and more over a clear **grammar**. Sadly, interactive plots are not supported on github but you can try them out on you local system. I highly recommned to give it a try.

## Approach
First things first, we will import necessary libraries and the dataset. As the goal is more about the process than the result, I chose a simple dataset available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is all about getting the feel of the data. Checking what is inside the dataset, what kind of values, understanding distributions, checking null values, realtionships between the features etc .. It is the most important step in building a model beacuse its all about the data.  
I start by reading the data into a pandas dataframe and go through the data and datatypes. Plots are best way to digest large datasets and get some insights. For example from the graph below, we can see that many passengers are between 20-35 of age and paid below 50$ for the ticket. A few assumptions can also be drawn like most of the infants and high paid passengers survived. Go through the code to look into more details.

### Data Pre-processing
From the conclusions derived from the EDA steps, we will process the data inorder to better suit for our models. This involves:
1. Dealing with Outliers
  Before we do any analysis, its better to take care of outliers as they might make our assumptions biased. There are various strategies available to detect outliers. I used Turkey method.
2. Dealing with skewness
  We prefer our data to resemble Gaussian distribution due to their friendly properties. Below is a figure where I transformed the data inorder to look like a guassian.

3. Dealing with dimensionality
  Since the dataset is small, I didn't use any techniques to decrease the features. But I dropped few features that might not have any effect on the output.
4. Dealing with null values
  Null values should be treated as they can cause many errors during model building. There are different methods to fill null values. Simplest one is to fill with random values using mean and standard deviation or using medians. But a better approach would be figuring out null value using its correlation with other features. Below is a figure showing correlations between `Age` and other features.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is where we try to build new features from existing features. Maybe combining or tweaking features to better suit our model. For our dataset, I have dropped `Name` but we can instead try to tweak the feature and get something useful for our model like Dr or other rare titles in the name is impacting their survivability. Also we can combine `SibSp` and `Parch` into a single feature of `family_size`. So feature engineering is all about engineering our features to better fit our model to give better predictions. But I feel `Name` might not impact survivability so much (tbh I am lazy), so I left it.  

To deal with categorical values, we use one hot encoding techique. To be more precise, if the data is in numbers, our model might try to establish a relation between the data by treating numbers as some order of relation. This might be helpful in many cases, but not if those numbers represent categories. This is mainly done using `ColumnTranformer()` or `OneHotEncoder` from sklearn or `get_dummies()` form pandas.
### Building Supervised ML Models
I used following models in the code:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Perceptron
3. K Nearest Neighbors
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes
6. Decision Trees
7. Random Forest
8. AdaBoost
9. Gradient Boosting
10. Voting Classifier  

In the notebook, I have added my **personal notes** for most of the models to understand how the algorithm works. I progressively built on different concepts and applications of **cross validation** techniques, **hyperparameter optimization**, **Ensemble** techniques. Below are the snapshots of feature importance from a tree based model and overall accuracies leaving the final ensemble respectively.
